# University

Since a couple of friends requested my code from my previous years, I decided to upload it as clean as possible. New code will be uploaded as soon as the year ends. Feel free to copy anything you need and ask me (with a little bit of luck I will remember sth about the project).

If you aren't here for an assignment, you probably won't find anything interesting. The code here doesn't represent me whatsoever and my way of programming changes drastically from year to year, so you are warned from finding a ton of bugs.

Whenever I program I use english. However, when I have to do university projects, that's not the case. Most of the code is in spanish, and in the case of the third year, german can appear in the wild.
